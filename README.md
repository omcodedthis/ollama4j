[ollama-docker-shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Ollama-Docker-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=gray

#### Installation

In your Maven project, add this dependency available in
the [Central Repository](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~ollama4j):

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.amithkoujalgi</groupId>
    <artifactId>ollama4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

You might want to include the Maven repository to pull the ollama4j library from. Include this in
your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ollama4j-from-ossrh</id>
        <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

You should also include [SL4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) in your `pom.xml` file if you encounter any errors related to this.

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.9</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Build:

Build your project to resolve the dependencies:

```shell
mvn clean install -U
```

You can then use the Ollama Java APIs by importing `ollama4j`:

```java
import io.github.amithkoujalgi.ollama4j.core.OllamaAPI;
```

### Try out the APIs with Ollama server

For simplest way to get started, I prefer to use the Ollama server in a docker setup.

Start the Ollama docker container:

```shell
docker run -it -v ~/ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama
```

With GPUs

```shell
docker run -it --gpus=all -v ~/ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama
```

Instantiate `OllamaAPI`

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);

        // set verbose - true/false
        ollamaAPI.setVerbose(true);
    }
}
```

#### Pull a model:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ollamaAPI.pullModel(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2);
    }
}
```

_Find the list of available models from Ollama [here](https://ollama.ai/library)._

#### List models:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        List<Model> models = ollamaAPI.listModels();
        models.forEach(model -> System.out.println(model.getName()));
    }
}
```

Response:

```shell
llama2:latest
sqlcoder:latest
```

#### Get model details:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ModelDetail modelDetails = ollamaAPI.getModelDetails(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2);
        System.out.println(modelDetails);
    }
}
```

}
```

#### Create model:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ollamaAPI.createModel("mycustommodel", "/path/to/modelfile/on/ollama-server");
    }
}
```

#### Delete model:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ollamaAPI.setVerbose(false);
        ollamaAPI.deleteModel("mycustommodel", true);
    }
}
```

#### Generate embeddings:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        List<Double> embeddings = ollamaAPI.generateEmbeddings(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2,
                "Here is an article about llamas...");
        embeddings.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

#### Ask a question to the model with ollama4j

##### Using sync API:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        OllamaResult response = ollamaAPI.ask(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2, "Who are you?");
        System.out.println(response.getResponse());
    }
}
```

##### Using async API:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        OllamaAsyncResultCallback ollamaAsyncResultCallback = ollamaAPI.askAsync(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2,
                "Who are you?");
        while (true) {
            if (ollamaAsyncResultCallback.isComplete()) {
                System.out.println(ollamaAsyncResultCallback.getResponse());
                break;
            }
            // introduce sleep to check for status with a time interval
            // Thread.sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
```

You'd then get a response from the model:

> I am LLaMA, an AI assistant developed by Meta AI that can understand and respond to human input in
> a conversational
> manner. I am trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet and can generate human-like
> responses to a wide
> range of topics and questions. I can be used to create chatbots, virtual assistants, and other
> applications that
> require
> natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

#### Try asking a question from general topics:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);

        String prompt = "List all cricket world cup teams of 2019.";
        OllamaResult response = ollamaAPI.ask(OllamaModelType.LLAMA2, prompt);
        System.out.println(response.getResponse());
    }
}
```

You'd then get a response from the model:

> The 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was held in England and Wales from May 30 to July 14, 2019. The
> following teams
> participated in the tournament:
>
> 1. Australia
> 2. Bangladesh
> 3. England
> 4. India
> 5. New Zealand
> 6. Pakistan
> 7. South Africa
> 8. Sri Lanka
> 9. West Indies
>
> These teams competed in a round-robin format, with the top four teams advancing to the
> semi-finals. The tournament was
> won by the England cricket team, who defeated New Zealand in the final.

#### Try asking for a Database query for your data schema:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);

        String prompt = SamplePrompts.getSampleDatabasePromptWithQuestion(
                "List all customer names who have bought one or more products");
        OllamaResult response = ollamaAPI.ask(OllamaModelType.SQLCODER, prompt);
        System.out.println(response.getResponse());
    }
}
```

_Note: Here I've used
a [sample prompt](https://github.com/amithkoujalgi/ollama4j/blob/main/src/main/resources/sample-db-prompt-template.txt)
containing a database schema from within this library for demonstration purposes._

You'd then get a response from the model:

```sql
-- noinspection SqlResolve
SELECT customers.name
FROM sales
         JOIN customers ON sales.customer_id = customers.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.name;
```

#### Try asking some questions by passing images 🖼️:

<img src='https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/96/63/80/360_F_296638053_0gUVA4WVBKceGsIr7LNqRWSnkusi07dq.jpg' width='200' alt="ollama4j-icon">

With Files:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ollamaAPI.setRequestTimeoutSeconds(10);

        OllamaResult response = ollamaAPI.askWithImageFiles(OllamaModelType.LLAVA,
                "What's in this image?",
                List.of(
                        new File("/path/to/image")));
        System.out.println(response);
    }
}
```

With URLs:

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "http://localhost:11434/";
        OllamaAPI ollamaAPI = new OllamaAPI(host);
        ollamaAPI.setRequestTimeoutSeconds(10);

        OllamaResult response = ollamaAPI.askWithImageURLs(OllamaModelType.LLAVA,
                "What's in this image?",
                List.of(
                        "https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/96/63/80/360_F_296638053_0gUVA4WVBKceGsIr7LNqRWSnkusi07dq.jpg"));
        System.out.println(response);
    }
}
```

You'd then get a response from the model:

```
This image features a white boat with brown cushions, where a dog is sitting on the back of the boat. 
The dog seems to be enjoying its time outdoors, perhaps on a lake.
```

#### Async API with streaming response

```java

@SuppressWarnings("ALL")
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

### Areas of improvement

- [x] Use Java-naming conventions for attributes in the request/response models instead of the
  snake-case conventions. (
  possibly with Jackson-mapper's `@JsonProperty`)
- [x] Fix deprecated HTTP client code
- [x] Setup logging
- [x] Use lombok
- [x] Update request body creation with Java objects
- [ ] Async APIs for images
- [ ] Add additional params for `ask` APIs such as:
    - `options`: additional model parameters for the Modelfile such as `temperature`
    - `system`: system prompt to (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)
    - `template`: the full prompt or prompt template (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)
    - `context`: the context parameter returned from a previous request, which can be used to keep a
      short
      conversational memory
    - `stream`: Add support for streaming responses from the model
- [ ] Add test cases
- [ ] Handle exceptions better (maybe throw more appropriate exceptions)
